## Programming Languages

*Programming for 10 years.*

These are the top three languages that I would clearly say I'm very competent in. I'm also always digging around in other languages, just for fun. A few other notable mentions are Scala, Lua, Javascript, Haskell, and Kotlin.

- Java
- Python
- Typescript

## Data Science

*2 years professional experience*

My current position involves a fair amount of Data Science work, crunching through lots of text on a pretty big Hortonworks cluster. I started out mainly doing my work in straight java MapReduce before switching onwards to mostly hive. We also did a fun Spark project with a bunch of machine learning.

- MapReduce
- Hive
- Spark
- Machine Learning
- Python

## Automation

*2 years professional experience*

I've been doing a lot more ansible automation that I thought I would, having made entirely new automation suites for several projects that I worked on. I spent a few months dockerizing components on another team as well, helping set the way it would be done after I left.

- Ansible
- Docker

## SQL

*2 years professional experience*

A necessity for basic business logic on any backend. I also use it with a distributed file system through Hive professionally.

- MySQL
- Hive
- PostgreSQL
